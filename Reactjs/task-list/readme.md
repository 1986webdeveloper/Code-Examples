# Task list with add, edit and delete features


This is a very simple and clear style to represent Reactjs application for Task list. This application has basic validation for add/edit/delete tasks. 
To represent more features in one application we use bootstrap model for edit and add task is done using page form.

-Add Task

-Update Task

-Remove Task

-Validations.


## Library list which are used in this application ##

-React Js 

-JSTransform Library 

-jQuery	

-Bootstrap css 

-Bootstrap modal





## Notes: ##

- The template syntax in React is called JSX, which is allowed to put HTML tags directly into JavaScript codes. 

- In ReactJs ReactDOM.render() is the method which translates JSX into HTML, and renders it into the specified DOM node.

-Please remember component's first letter must be capitalized, otherwise React will throw an error.
