## Notes: ##

- The template syntax in React is called JSX, which is allowed to put HTML tags directly into JavaScript codes. 

- In ReactJs ReactDOM.render() is the method which translates JSX into HTML, and renders it into the specified DOM node.

-Please remember component's first letter must be capitalized, otherwise React will throw an error. 



**You have to just download zip or take git clone and directly run index.html file in any browser and DONE!!!.**
