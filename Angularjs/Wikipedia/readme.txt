=== Wikipedia Search With AngularJS ===
== Description ==
We have developed the Wikipedia search functionality by using the angular script.
This is very simple to use. We have used a different module like ui.bootstrap, autocomplete for search, en.wikipedia.org/w/api to get the search data and controller to search on click from the module and you can navigate different result there on typing.
We have used latest tooltip method on hover search result to display its content there and also you can redirect to the related wiki page from there directly.
It’s very simple to use and navigate for any user interface purpose.
